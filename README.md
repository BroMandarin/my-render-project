# My render project

This project was derived from the "empty" project template.

The settings in ["game.project"](defold://open?path=/game.project) are all the default except:

- Main
	- Bootstrap
		- Render: set to my custom render
- Runtime
	- Graphics
		- Default Texture Min Filter: nearest
		- Default Texture Mag Filter: nearest
	- Input
		- Use Accelerometer: off

A bootstrap empty ["main.collection"](defold://open?path=/main/main.collection) is included.

A custom ["render script"](defold://open?path=/render/my.render_script) is included.

Check out [the documentation pages](https://defold.com/learn) for examples, tutorials, manuals and API docs.

If you run into trouble, help is available in [our forum](https://forum.defold.com).

Happy Defolding!
